            <p><b>Is Your Pet Microchipped?</b></p>
            <p>On average 1 in 3 pets go missing from their homes in their lifetime.  Life often brings about unexpected situations.  Make sure your pet is prepared!  Microchips help to reunite these pets in their homes.  If you are interested in another layer of protection, consider providing your pet's microchip to Bloomington Animal Care and Control.   This will allow Animal Control Officer to reunite you with your pet more quickly, often avoiding shelter stays!  If your pet is not currently microchipped, your veterinarian, the staff at the Animal Shelter or one of these organizations would be happy to assist!</p>

            <p><b> Do dogs need leashes and can cats roam free?</b></p>
            <p>All dogs are required to be on a leash under the control of their owner any time they are off the owners property.  We understand your desire to give your dog freedom and exercise.  It is both good for them and for you, however we share this space with wild animals, people with allergies and fear, and dogs that are not fans of new dogs in their space.  Please be respectful of your neighbors and prevent unfortunate accidents by keeping your dogs on leash.  For the times you want off leash play time check out the City's two dog parks at Ferguson or Switchyard.</p>
            <p>Cats that are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and wearing collars and tags are allowed to roam free.  However free roaming cats in the course of their normal activities can become a nuisance to your neighbors.  This can lead to citations from an animal control officer.  In addition free roaming cats can make a negative impact on our native bird and small animal populations.  Before letting your cat roam free, consider utilizing a catio or fencing your yard with cat proof fencing.  These options limit predation and potential conflicts with your neighbors while allowing your cat to experience the joys of being outside in their natural environment.</p>
