        <div class="FAQ-Card">
            <h3>Is Your Pet Microchipped?</h3>
            <p>On average 1 in 3 pets go missing from their homes in their lifetime.  Life often brings about unexpected situations.  Make sure your pet is prepared!  Microchips help to reunite these pets in their homes.  If you are interested in another layer of protection, consider providing your pet's microchip to Bloomington Animal Care and Control.   This will allow Animal Control Officer to reunite you with your pet more quickly, often avoiding shelter stays!  If your pet is not currently microchipped, your veterinarian, the staff at the Animal Shelter or one of these organizations would be happy to assist!</p>

        <div class="FAQ-Card">
            <h3>Do dogs need leashes and can cats roam free?</h3> 
            <p>All dogs are required to be on a leash under the control of their owner any time they are off the owners property.  We understand your desire to give your dog freedom and exercise.  It is both good for them and for you, however we share this space with wild animals, people with allergies and fear, and dogs that are not fans of new dogs in their space.  Please be respectful of your neighbors and prevent unfortunate accidents by keeping your dogs on leash.  For the times you want off leash play time check out the City's two dog parks at Ferguson or Switchyard.</p>
            <p>Cats that are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and wearing collars and tags are allowed to roam free.  However free roaming cats in the course of their normal activities can become a nuisance to your neighbors.  This can lead to citations from an animal control officer.  In addition free roaming cats can make a negative impact on our native bird and small animal populations.  Before letting your cat roam free, consider utilizing a catio or fencing your yard with cat proof fencing.  These options limit predation and potential conflicts with your neighbors while allowing your cat to experience the joys of being outside in their natural environment.</p>

  <h3>What should I do if I find a lost or stray animal?</h3>
  <p>
    If you find a lost or stray animal, please contact Bloomington Animal Care and Control as soon as possible. 
    Animal Control Officers are trained to safely handle unfamiliar animals and can check for identification such as 
    tags or microchips. If the animal is friendly and you are able to safely contain it, you may be asked to hold the 
    animal temporarily while officers work to locate the owner. For injured or aggressive animals, do not attempt to 
    handle them and call immediately.

<div class="FAQ-Card">
  <h3>What are the requirements for licensing my dog or cat?</h3>
  <p>
    All dogs and cats residing within city limits are required to be licensed annually. To obtain a license, pets must 
    be up to date on their rabies vaccination. Licensing helps ensure that pets can be quickly reunited with their owners 
    if they become lost and supports local animal services. Proof of vaccination is required at the time of licensing.

    to Bloomington Animal Care and Control as soon as possible. Reporting helps protect both the injured person and your 
    pet by ensuring proper follow-up and compliance with local regulations. Animal Control staff can guide you through
